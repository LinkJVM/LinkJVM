##Java on the KIPR Link

##About LinkJVM
LinkJVM is a Java Environment of the [KIPR Link](http://www.kipr.org/products/link/) and allows the execution of very Java language and acually very JVM supported language such as Scala and Javascript (over [Rhino](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Rhino).

##Java?
####Why is the opportunity to program the robot in Java important?
+ First, the most students in school get started in programming using Java, so they should be able to use the learned skills in botball.
+ Java provides automatic garbage collection and an excellent set of basic data types like lists, maps and so on.
+ Compared to C Java has a much better maintainability especially in very large libraries because of object orientation.

####Isn´t Java much slower than C?
+ No, not much. Of course is Java slower the C, but not that much. In another way: For normal usage it won´t make a difference.

####So are there Benchmarks?
+ No, I have not had the time to generate benchmark for LinkJVM yet, but I plan to make one.

##Installing LinkJVM
Basically there are two different ways to install LinkJVM:
